<h1 align=center>simpex</h1>

`simpex` is a python library that simplifies the process of using regular expressions (`regex`). It provides custom, built-in and api-based methods to generate regex patterns, making it easier for developers to match and manipulate text data. Whether you're working with emails, URLs, phone numbers, or other patterns, `simpex` has you covered.

#### _Features_:

- Simplify regex usage in Python.
- Generate regex patterns effortlessly.
- Access external APIs for regex generation.
- Choose from custom or built-in patterns.

## Installation | [wiki](../../wiki/installation)

To install `simpex`, use the following command:

```bash
pip install simpex
```

<br>

## Usage | [wiki](../../wiki/usage)

There are three steps between you and regex pattern you want! Follow below instatructions as _quick guide_, please chak out _[wiki]()_ for comprehensive usage with examples.

### 1. Importing

- Use the following import statement:

```python
from simpex.simpex import simpex
```

### 2. Creating Object

- `simpex` is a class, so we need to __create an object__ with required parametric data (check [wiki](../../wiki/usage#custom-method), for all available parameters)

```python
# creating an onject named `email`
email = simpex(['test@mail.com', 'admin@email.com', 'example@mail.co'])
```

### 3. Calling Method

- Call your desired method from [`custom*`](../../wiki/usage#custom-method), [`built-in`](../../wiki/usage#built-in-method) or [`api-based`](../../wiki/usage#api-method) to get regex pattern (check [wiki](../../wiki/usage#methods), for all avaliable methods)

```python
# calling custom method
pattern = email.regex()
```

> output: `print(pattern)` -> `^[a-z]+\@[a-z]+\.[a-z]*$`
