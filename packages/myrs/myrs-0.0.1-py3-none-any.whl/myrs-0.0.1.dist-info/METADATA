# 💧 Myr 

*"High Performance Machine Learning Primitives"*

**Myr** is an **experimental** attempt to provide **high performance implementation** of some ML/DL algorithms using [Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) the End to End Machine Learning Compiler Framework for several target architectures. The long-term goal of the project is to be able to build some generic **high performance ML primitives** (ie. building blocks) by providing **high-level** TVM abstractions easily reusable by the user.

The goals (first draft) :
- At first **satisfy my willingness** to deep dive into **Machine Learning Compilation** and **High Performance** ML algorithms.
- Be **useful**...(a hard goal 😅) by provinding **simple** optimized reusable primitives...  

## ⚠️ Warnings

For the moment :

- The development of the project takes place in a private github repository
- The project is at the very early stage -> Nothing is implemented in this published version
 - The documentation is missing


Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to know more or are interested in !😃

The project will be highly collaborative🤝, so everyone is welcome to the project ! 🤗  
Contributions could be done in many ways and are not exclusively code. You could write documentation ( very important !😉), participate to the community creation (slack,matrix,gitter...) etc ...

The repository as well as a "usable" python package will be available in the upcoming months when the project will be more advanced. Stay tuned ! 🗓️
