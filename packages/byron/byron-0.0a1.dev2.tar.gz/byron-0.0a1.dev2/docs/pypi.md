`byron` is an [evolutionary tool](https://squillero.github.io/byron/evolution.html): given a problem, it first creates a set of random solutions, then iteratively refines and enhances them using the result of their evaluations together with structural information, routinely outperforming both human experts and conventional heuristics. It is able to tackle problem those solutions are simple fixed-length bit strings, as well as to optimize realistic assembly programs including loops, interrupts and recursive sub routines; and candidate solutions can be evaluated using proprietary external tools.
