Grig is a fully N-dimensional resampling package for irregularly
gridded data.  It was primarily developed for generating astronomical
image mosaics and spectral image cubes, but has broad applicability
to scientific data arrays with or without associated errors.

For more information about installing and using this package, see
the `online documentation <https://SOFIA-USRA.github.io/grig/>`__,
or `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`__ in the source distribution.
