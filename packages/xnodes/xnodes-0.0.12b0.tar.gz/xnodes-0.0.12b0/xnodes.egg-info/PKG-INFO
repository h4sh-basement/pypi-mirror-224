    XNodes (Exchanging nodes) provides a global event bus to which individual nodes can connect to and send events to 
    other nodes. Nodes do not know each other, they communicate via the event bus by their individual IDs.
    The framework also provides a possibility for nodes to offer undo-events when receiving events. If an event alters
    the state of a node, the node has then the responsibility to provide an event which undos the changes made by the
    received event. Those undo-events are stored by the event bus and can then be fed again into the system.
