# StableFused

StableFused is a toy library to experiment with Stable Diffusion inspired by ðŸ¤— diffusers and various other sources!

## Installation

For usage, install the package from PyPI.

```bash
pip install stablefused
```

For development, fork the repository, clone it and install the package in editable mode.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/stablefused.git
cd stablefused
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

Checkout the [examples](./examples) folder for notebooks ðŸ¥°

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Note that this project is not a serious implementation for training/inference/fine-tuning diffusion models. It is a toy library. I am working on it for fun and experimentation purposes (and because I'm too stupid to modify large codebases and understand what's going on).

As I'm not an expert in this field, I will have probably made a lot of mistakes. If you find any, please open an issue or a PR. I'll be happy to learn from you!

## Results

#### Visualization of diffusion process

These results are generated using the [text_to_image](https://github.com/a-r-r-o-w/stablefused/blob/main/examples/text_to_image_diffusion.ipynb) notebook. Refer to the notebook for more details and enjoy the denoising process!
