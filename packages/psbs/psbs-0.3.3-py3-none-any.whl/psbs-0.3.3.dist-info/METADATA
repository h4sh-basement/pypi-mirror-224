# PSBS

The PuzzleScript Build System!

PSBS combines multiple files into one puzzlescript source file and can export it to an HTML file or an online game hosted on a gist!

For more information view the [official PSBS Documentation](https://jcmiller11.github.io/PSBS/)

## Contributing

While I'd be grateful to receive pull requests, at this moment in time prior to doing an official 1.0.0 release what I would really like help with is testing!  Please use PSBS to its fullest and if you encounter any odd behaviors don't hesitate to raise an Issue!

I would like PSBS to have friendly error handling that returns nice, brief, and useful error messages rather than a full stack trace, however it's challenging to make sure I've caught every possible exception, so if you run into a stack trace while using PSBS please raise an Issue!
