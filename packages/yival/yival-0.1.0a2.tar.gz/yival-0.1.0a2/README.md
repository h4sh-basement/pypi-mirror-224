## About

YiVal is an adaptable AI development framework, designed to provide a tailored experimentation experience. Whether you're a hands-on developer or leaning into automation, YiVal is equipped for both:

- **Data Input**: Choose between manual data input or let the framework handle auto-generation.
- **Variations**: Manually set parameter and prompt variations or utilize the automated capabilities for optimal settings.
- **Evaluation**: Engage with manual evaluators or leverage the built-in automated evaluators for efficient results.

On the horizon is the YiVal Agent, an ambitious addition aimed at autonomously driving the entire experimentation process. With its blend of manual and automated features, YiVal stands as a comprehensive solution for AI experimentation, ensuring flexibility and efficiency every step of the way.
