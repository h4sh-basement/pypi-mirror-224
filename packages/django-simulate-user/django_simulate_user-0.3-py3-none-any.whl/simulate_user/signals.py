def send_simulation_notification(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """
    Sends an email notification to the real user when a new simulated user session is created.

    This function is connected to the post_save signal of the SimulatedUserSession model.
    It is triggered every time an instance of this model is saved. The function checks
    if this is a new record and, if so, prepares and sends an email notification to the real user.

    Parameters:
    - sender: The model class. (SimulatedUserSession in this case)
    - instance: The actual instance being saved.
    - created: Boolean indicating whether this instance is being created.
               If it's an update to an existing instance, created is False.
    - **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments.

    Email Templates Used:
    - 'simulateuser/simulation_email_subject.txt': Used for the email subject.
    - 'simulateuser/simulation_email.txt': Used for the plain text content of the email.
    - 'simulateuser/simulation_email.html': Used for the HTML content of the email.

    The templates will be rendered with a context containing the following variables:
    - real_user: The actual user who initiated the simulation.
    - simulated_user: The user being simulated.
    - timestamp: The time when the simulation started.
