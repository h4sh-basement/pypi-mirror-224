
# SimulateUser Django App

## General Details

### Description

The SimulateUser Django app provides developers with a robust toolset to simulate user experiences within their web applications. By impersonating a specific user or even an anonymous user, developers can observe user experiences firsthand, enabling easier debugging, testing, and understanding of user interfaces and functionality.

### Features
 - **Private Tags Functionality**: Safeguard sensitive content in templates with `{% private %}` and `{% privateblock %}` tags.

 - **Fully Simulated Sessions**: Impersonate any user in the system, including anonymous users, with a complete session simulation.

 - **Transparency with Notifications & Logs**: Stay informed about all simulation activities through comprehensive notifications and logs.

 - **Customizable with Settings**: Tweak the app behavior according to project requirements. It's important to note that this app should not be used in production environments due to potential security concerns.

 - **Extendable Template with UI**: An aesthetically pleasing user interface for switching users is available in the simulate_user_base.html template, which can be extended by any template in your project.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install the App**:
```
pip install django-simulate-user
```

1. **Add the App**: 
Include 'simulateuser' in your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'simulate_user',

2. **Add the URLs**:
Ensure that you add the app's URL configurations to your project's urls.py:

    ...
]
```

3. **Middleware and Context Manager**:
Ensure you add the necessary middleware and context manager for the app in the respective Django settings:
```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    'simulate_user.middleware.SimulateUserMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        ...
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                ...
                'simulate_user.context_processors.simulate_user_context', 
                ...
            ],
        },
        ...
