IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

for reference but we are not actively supporting compatibility with pymc3 after
further notice.


Chapter 5: Probabilistic Modeling
---------------------------------

These examples introduce shortly some Bayesian statistics concepts and
show how to build with GemPy stochastic structural models. This functionality
is currently under active development and research. Much more to come soon.
