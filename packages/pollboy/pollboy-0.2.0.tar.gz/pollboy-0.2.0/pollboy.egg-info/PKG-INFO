## Pollboy

Simple script to poll an RSS feed and send notifications about new posts. Currently only supports Telegram Bot notifications. 

This script is meant to be scheduled with cron to run at regular intervals.

Install

```
pip install pollboy
```

Run

```
pollboy
```

The first run will generate a config file at `~/.config/pollboy.config.yaml`. Update feeds and notification settings here.

Note - `rss_url` can be either a local file path or remote URL.

By default, pollboy will store the timestamp from the last post it sent a notification for. If you want to disable this functionality for testing you can set a top-level variable in the config.yaml file:

```
disable_db: True
```
