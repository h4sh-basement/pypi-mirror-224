        What is RefStack?
        #################
        
        - Toolset for testing interoperability between OpenStack clouds.
        - Database backed website supporting collection and publication of
          Community Test results for OpenStack.
        - User interface to display individual test run results.
        
        RefStack intends on being THE source of tools for interoperability testing
        of OpenStack clouds.
        
        RefStack provides users in the OpenStack community with a Tempest wrapper,
        refstack-client, that helps to verify interoperability of their cloud
        with other OpenStack clouds. It does so by validating any cloud
        implementation against the OpenStack Tempest API tests.
        
        Refstack's Use Case
        ###################
        
        **RefStack and Interop Working Group** - The prototypical use case for RefStack
        provides the Interop Working Group - formerly known as DefCore committee - the
        tools for vendors and other users to run API tests against their clouds to
        provide the WG with a reliable overview of what APIs and capabilities are
        being used in the marketplace. This will help to guide the Interop
        Working Group defined capabilities and help ensure interoperability across
        the entire OpenStack ecosystem. It can also be used to validate clouds
        against existing capability lists, giving you assurance that your cloud
        faithfully implements OpenStack standards.
        
        **Value add for openstack distro or solution vendors** - Vendors can use
        RefStack to demonstrate that their distros, and/or their customers' installed
        clouds remain OpenStack compliant after their software has been incorporated
        into the distro or cloud.
        
        **RefStack consists of two parts:**
        
        * **refstack-api**
           Our API isn't just for us to collect data from private and public cloud
           vendors. It can be used by vendors in house to compare interoperability
           data over time.

           refstack-client contains the tools you will need to run the
           Interop Working Group tests.
