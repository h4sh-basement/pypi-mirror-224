With more and more cheap legendary permanents printed every year, and a decent number of those being already available, it will regularly outperform other low-cost aggressive commanders, even with an average draw. Therefore, we've decided to ban Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful in order to maintain diversity among aggressive strategies."
