The role it plays is unparalleled when confronted with a game whose strategy is similar, allowing expansion and uncompromising interaction to be combined at the maximum speed of development, which greatly unbalances the game. Also recognized as being used by otherwise high-performing games, Deadly Rollick is banned.">Deadly Rollick</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Flawless Maneuver is a card that fulfills two roles. It allows protecting owned creatures from destruction spells or making them immune to combat damage. This is a card intended to be used by strategies that favor the domination of the battlefield. Its potential is maximized by low mana cost commanders. Those commanders which structurally benefit from Duel Commander rules. It provides a shelter that allows neglecting any risk-taking related to the maximum expansion on the battlefield and plays with the strategic implications of engaging in creature combat. The readability of this card is particularly complicated as it is not represented by mana availability. Its use by recognized dominant games is also a reason why Flawless Maneuver is now banned.">Flawless Maneuver</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="The One Ring is a problematic card for Duel Commander. The mass of resources that this card brings is considerable and all strategies can benefit from it, without restriction of color identity. In decks that are designed to maximize threat within a minimum time, it's a permanent that serves the purpose of generating a second wind perfectly, and sits at a point on the mana curve that fits exactly such a need. The drawback of the card is compensated here by the gap in life points that these games aim to produce prior to the use of The One Ring. Games designed to achieve later game mastery can use The One Ring to advantage against all strategies. If the situation is problematic due to an unfavorable balance in terms of creature possession, the effect triggered when this permanent enters the battlefield is likely to absorb the loss of life points caused by several of its activations. If the situation is one of a confrontation based essentially on the accumulation of resources, The One Ring gives its controller the key to victory. In games designed to win the game by the effect of the explosive combination of certain cards, The One Ring is once again ideal, due to its ability to protect the capital of life points while stimulating the search for cards essential to the achievement of the game plan.">The One Ring</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Faced with an increasingly powerful evolution of cards, spot removals have seen their costs reduced and many more of them are now able to interact early in the game. Eidolon of the Great Revel is a powerful aggressive card that has the ability to hinder players from performing a chain of several cards to achieve a powerful effect, but it retains weaknesses against other aggressive games. Given its contribution to the format, Eidolon of the Great Revel is now legal.">Eidolon of the Great Revel</a> is now <strong>legal</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="High Tide is an archetype by itself. When it was banned, this archetype had the upper hand against control decks. However, the proactive strategies that were available at the time were either not disruptive enough, or not fast enough to keep High Tide in check. Now that such decks exist, High Tide could provide a different way to play combo, and thus provide more diversity to the metagame, while, at the same time, keeping the powerful control shell in check.">High Tide</a> is now <strong>legal</strong>.</p></div></div>

However, its role as an enabler is very powerful, especially since it indeed enables not one, but two different gameplans. At first, it acts as a good way to play a classic Reanimate-like plan, as it allows putting powerful but expensive creatures in the graveyard. But also, the mana it gives allows naturally casting that same creature even without a Reanimate-like effect. Historically, reanimation decks have always been weak when not getting access to such reanimation effects in a game. But Dihada, Binder of Wills effectively solves this problem by giving tons of mana to cast game breakers. In short, it tends to be more of a hybrid reanimating and ramp deck than a proper combo deck, making most of the usual solutions against reanimator pointless (i.e. graveyard hate, hand disruption, etc.). Last, but not the least, the deck makes full use of Underworld Breach, giving it one more game plan with minimal drawback. For this reason, Dihada, Binder of Wills tends to have very few bad matchups, having an edge against aggressive, midrange, and control decks, while being by far one of the best combo decks available. Immune to usual hate cards, with very few predators, and having too many gameplans in a single deck, we chose to ban Dihada, Binder of Wills as a commander.">Dihada, Binder of Wills</a> is now <strong>banned</strong> as a commander.</p><p class="description"><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Comet, Stellar Pup is a very difficult card to evaluate. While it's sometimes underwhelming, it may also close a game straight after being cast, with a little luck on dice rolls. Similarly, you may sometimes take some strategic decisions, and sometimes just let yourself be carried by the dog. In the end, its raw power level is quite hard to determine, and its design makes for one of the poorest possible game experiences in Magic The Gathering: which is why Comet, Stellar Pup is now banned.">Comet, Stellar Pup</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Right now, Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis is one of the best decks in Duel Commander (if not the best). It's able to dominate any aggressive mirror, being at least even (if not positive) against control decks, its traditional predators. However, the deck was a bit behind against some combo decks, the main one being Dihada, Binder of Wills. By removing Dihada, Binder of Wills, Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis will undoubtedly be the best deck in the format, leaving very few possibilities to explore other archetypes, especially in the aggressive category, killing diversity. How did it come to this? Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis has indeed been around for some time, being a powerful deck since its printing. At first, it was crippled by its lack of stability: the best structural cards in the deck, like Satyr Wayfinder, were only available as a single card. Recent printings, however, changed a lot of things: first, a lot of redundancy has been added to the deck, streamlining its gameplay, and making successive Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis casts very easy. If a "wrath" effect used to be enough to slow the deck, it tends to be less and less effective, thus making the match-up positive, and progressively removing any bad match-up. That being said, some of the problems disappear if we're talking about playing Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis as a card apart from choosing it as a commander. Some, however, remain: the card is a game plan by itself, while being very easy to search for. While Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath was a recursive tool for control decks, Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis appears to be in a very similar position for some decks. To prevent any future abuse of the card, we chose to ban Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis in any starting game zone.">Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Being the last of the current Mox cards available with potential when playing Duel Commander, Mox Amber has always been a card debated by many. With the rise of strong decks making use of cheap commanders such as the Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful-based variants, Mox Amber has been put in the spotlight, showing that it will always be a problem as long as it has a commander to support it, regardless of the power level of the latter. Since games with an early Mox card in play tend to be very one-sided, limiting any strategic decisions and breaking the natural flow of early Magic The Gathering resources, while giving another edge to the already powerful advantage of playing a cheap commander, we chose to ban Mox Amber.">Mox Amber</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.</p></div></div>

Even though their respective abilities refer to a way different set of cards (something around 4.8 times more related cards for Necrotic Ooze), the current combination of cards which (most generally) allows them to win instantly end up being pretty much the same. All other cards involved not being particularly damaging the player experience, it still seems that the central piece of all of them needs to go. As the final results end up with a very cheap-to-include, hard-to-answer win condition, the conclusion still remains the same: it generates a lot of unwanted bad player experience on the field. the small play uptick given by the fact that Trazyn the Infinite can also be a commander barely adds a little more to the whole, but yet remains noticeable, on top of it. This also greatly helped as a reminder that Necrotic Ooze being legal again wasn't totally a good idea (not to mention cards like Old Stickfingers didn't even exist back when the first one was banned), hence Trazyn the Infinite goes to the dark shelf of cards banned in Duel Commander.">Trazyn the Infinite</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.</p></div></div>

This greatly made us move into winter announcements, which changed everything. For those reasons and because of those coincidences, Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful bore a very specific history: it was never legal on the day it was released, while being also a valid commander. Despite the new rules we added since then, it never was really tried by people, who didn't have the opportunity to play it. We believe it is worth giving it a try, and, as this situation is really singular, this change is an experimental one. A few things that make Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful a good candidate for this experiment: First, as mentioned earlier, it promotes an aggressive gameplan, something we like to see in the format as it's an interactive and interesting gameplay, and we hope it would let the archetype be on a par with the rest of the format. Second, it has never been available since our winter announcement. As it would be overpowered for sure under the older rules, it could now be in line with the power level of the format. Third, there are numerous ways to build this general, with choices ranging from choosing colors, to establishing the good ratio of synergic spells, etc. Which means this is something we could not test, even with a seasoned team of playtesters, and the best way to evaluate the card is to let you all, the community, work on it.">Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful</a> is now <strong>legal</strong>.</p></div></div>

It's not about building decks with an obliterating fast commander live. It's not about being a planeswalker as a commander. It's not about its colours. It's not about the extra card draws. It's not about the oppression of a super-early-blitz to mid-turns-targeted commander. It's not about commander-centric experiences. It's not about "respond or die" experiences. It's not about fighting 4/4 or 7/7 hasty, trampling creatures. Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes is about all of that, at the same time. Which makes it quite hard to evaluate. This is the first time we face all those aspects accumulated, in a way that can be handled (Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes saw countless wins… And defeats). But the sum of all nuisances is indeed very often a higher nuisance. Which is why, after debating over those aspects and many more we decided to ban Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes as a commander.">Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes</a> is now <strong>banned</strong> as a commander.</p></div></div>

Dodging removals that are universally played is a big advantage. They're supposed to remain acceptable considering that structural advantage. What's more, Shorikai is a very versatile tool: it gives board control, creates pure card advantage, and finally, can close games once they're under control. Having most of the fundamental tools needed to any control deck always available in the command zone is already a powerful advantage. Though, being an artifact and thus being hard to remove allowed the deck to rely near-exclusively on the commander: not having to play a lot of card advantage engines allowed the maindeck to be a lot more powerful without ever lacking resources. The advantages such a card provides quickly proved right the reasons mentioned herebefore for Shorikai, Genesis Engine to rise very high among final rankings widely more than an healthy format can contain. Those reasons won't be fixed unless a lot of metagame changes are made to a vast majority of decks, which might not even be enough. We chose to have Shorikai, Genesis Engine now banned as a commander.">Shorikai, Genesis Engine</a> is now <strong>banned</strong> as a commander.</p><p class="description"><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Bazaar of Baghdad is one of those problematic cards that share a lot of head-scratching when it comes to legality. It's not busted per se in Duel Commander, as over 15 years of existence, it rarely shined and failed to obliterate the format, despite its very unique and powerful ability. It crosses a lot of attention boundaries: being ultra-iconic, being almost 30-years old, being on the Wizards Of The Coast Reprint Policy list, being almost impossible to find or have it lent, fixing hands, filling graveyards, being a land that can't be responded to,... It even finally found a home commander with Rielle The Everwise, only to mention one. Bazaar of Baghdad also showed to be slightly more played online (when players didn't physically need the card) than on paper and not necessarily for testing concerns. The problem is that it has become playable over a small threshold, though still not totally mandatory in some performing decks. Despite its attractivity, the fact that such a card now belongs to museums more than to playing tables and the growing difficulty to get a hand on a copy in any way makes it externally and internally problematic for Duel Commander, a little more every day. We hence thought that it was the time for it to go.">Bazaar of Baghdad</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="There were heavy debates upon which Magic The Gathering card, out of any context, was the best play for a one-mana, turn one play. Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer currently ended those debates. Even though it's still totally feasible to play against it, the pressure, the need for an answer, the additional resources provided still make it usually turn the tides in favour of whoever slammed it on their first turn. The structural reason why it was initially banned as a commander still applies to the one-shot opportunity of starting with it. As it is not even a dead card on the late game (though way less of an oppressing one), Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer always held its position of a very fine aggression start for many decks, starting with mono-red aggressive builds. Though this can be a little subtle to spot (it still remains a permanently-dead 2/1 after all), the advantage it gives when not handled in time creates too much difference in favour of whoever played it first on an average, also solving a construction problematic for such aggressive decks.">Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Serra's Sanctum has a long and complex history. Its most complex consideration factor resides in the bias of effect proximity, in the name of long banned cards that are Gaea's Cradle and Tolarian Academy. The proximity being "producing mana by just tapping, at no cost, up to X controlled archetype permanent of [type]". The other part of the analysis was hence set into the concerned type and the probability of finding them, as well as keeping them on a battlefield. Which results in a resilience versus playability fight (enchantments sticking more than artifacts which in turn stick more easily on a battlefield than creatures, while creatures are the predominant type in Magic, way ahead of enchantments then artifacts). Serra's Sanctum was the hardest to find a good setup for, and the hardest to exploit so far, which explains why it was still legal. But the growing number of newly printed cards which have a strong affinity for Serra's Sanctum suddenly made it visible. The decks that use it have the same outcome as Gaea's Cradle and Tolarian Academy: the restrictions were lighter and lighter, up to a point it finally allowed some complex situations to be solved on the spot, by solely entering a battlefield, allowing a sudden resource outburst which almost always ends up games. Which is why unfortunately, Serra's Sanctum has to join its siblings on the Duel Commander Banned & Restricted list.">Serra's Sanctum</a> is now <strong>banned</strong>.</p></div></div>

It actually is a 4/4 haste and flying, which is the kind of combination some aggressive and midrange decks already play (like Glorybringer, Stormbreath Dragon, Goldspan Dragon or Hell's Thunder, for instance). The fact it also has an extra drawing ability even helps a little against decks that would try to resolve two spells or bait with one lesser first. Once having exhausted an opponent's resources, or sometimes simply being played on time, Kraum, Ludevic's Opus actually becomes a quick win condition and fast way to get out of a game. That, in conjunction with another commander since the start of games, makes it a perfect choice to fill two critical slots: a cheaper one to start on curve and this one to finish games. Moreover, similar to Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel, but on the other side of the curve, Kraum, Ludevic's Opus allows the deckbuilder to always have a good late game tool without having to commit a lot of deck building space with their non-commander cards.

Since it can always be played on tempo, it demonstrated to be a sufficient strategic play by essence: being dropped as a simple 2/2 for {2} mana value, Livio offers a good curve advantage, allowing the deckbuilder to not play any bad 2-mana creature, thus enhancing the quality of the 99 others as it helps against bad/slow/diminished starting hands, in addition to being a second commander which offers a new color for many other ones. One year ago we thought it could remain a safe commander, but it appears to be too much for the format, which is why, in the end, we decided to ban Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel as a commander.">Livio, Oathsworn Sentinel</a> is now <strong>banned</strong> as a commander.<br><a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-title="Marath, Will of the Wild was originally banned in Duel Commander in July 2016.

Most decks six years ago used to be annihilating all other aggressive builds, but the tides have turned, and the current builds show that they can compete with such decks. It's probable that bringing it to the field will offer new opportunities for aggressive and/or combo decks, as it used to be in the idea, but with many new cards to include… And many more to face.

In a sense that they combine an aggressive plan on one side, through curving a 3/3 for {1} -generally on turn 1-2- and on the other side a critical mass of synergies based on discarding and graveyard use. All that does allow decks built around that commander to have an important recursion at disposal any time. Although it is undeniable that these decks suffer from a couple of bad match-ups, it still has a crushing advantage against other aggressive decks, mostly from recurring accessibility to removal effects.

Acting on the turn it enters the battlefield (just in a form of "improved haste") also requires vigilance from everyone, not so as to mention that the objects found in libraries become indestructible (a once super rare keyword that now became very common over the last 10 years, much like "hexproof" or "shroud", other anti-interactive keywords are). Lastly, it doesn't even need to be part of the combat step itself. Those characteristics thus present a similar problem to that of Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar : Winota, Joiner of Forces is an aggressive-combo deck that benefits from an overwhelmingly positive match-up against other aggressive decks, while being at least good against other archetypes. Again, diversity is diminished by this fact, and, following that logic, the simultaneous ban of Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar bears the risk of Winota, Joiner of Forces becoming the next problematic deck. Such oppressive commanders (or cards) that require immediate response, and the fact that the decks that play those cards also have a couple last-chance responses to opponents' responses aren't really what creates great game experiences. Again, here, being beaten by randomly revealed cards off the top of libraries doesn't create very warm feelings from people losing to those kinds of decks, especially when the price paid to do so isn't that much of a constraint.

In order to at least interact with their game plan, they require opponents to include very specific hate cards in sufficient quantity to be able to draw them regularly.

These decks completely polarized and shaped the metagame by eliminating any archetypes that can not offer both those characteristics at a time on one hand, while on the other forcing all other decks to notably modify their lists in a way that is beyond usual habits and needs.Besides, the eminence mechanic, which represents the cornerstone of the deck, forbids interacting with the combo sequence in a decent way.

Sometimes raw power isn't everything. Sometimes one ability can lead to a bad player experience. It is true that trying to define a good illustration of a decent player experience will probably end up being a lost cause, most of the time. Nevertheless, Esior, Wardwing Familiar, which landed with Commander Legends didn't prove to add anything to the sanity of Duel Commander, and showed up as quite a toxic generic commander to pair with almost any other card that shares the partner ability. The lack of interaction, coupled with both older and newer partner-centric strategies didn't really help our format breathe a little around such creatures. Over a tenth of different interactions and pairs showed quite good and viable results, and in the end, when all lead to the same disappointment, it means more than anything that Esior, Wardwing Familiar was the common problem.

Jeska, Thrice Reborn provides totally out-of-tempo damage to anything that hits the board, and creates a need for an immediate answer, which is not something red decks usually rely on.

In addition to this, Thassa's Oracle only has a converted mana cost of 2, which makes it not only easy to cast along with cards that empty the library on the same turn but also, due to its card types, make it very easy to search out of the deck by a wide variety cards.

Trading life for resources has always been a dangerous mechanic and it is even more dangerous when being done while being the aggressive deck. Ancient Tomb makes no exception to this and allows for explosive starts. By providing permanent extra mana on the turn it is played, it is a huge tempo gain - especially when it's used to cast and recast commanders. Whether being used to cast commanders or expensive spells like Damnation, Fiery Confluence or Thought-Knot Seer, the result often easily mitigates the damage done by Ancient Tomb most of the time.
