The easiest way to install troyalab is to download it from [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/project/troyalab/). It's going to install the library itself and its prerequisites as well.

```shell
$ pip install troyalab
```

Secondly, you can install deepface from its source code.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/troyalab-fatih/BG96_RASPBERY_PI
$ cd troyalab
$ pip install -e .
```

 Setup

Then you will be able to import the library and use its functionalities.

```python
import troyalab.RPi_Shield
```

You can connect to the card by typing which port your Troyalab RPi Shield is connected to.

```python
troyalab = troyalab.RPi_Shield.BG96("/dev/ttyS0")
```

Then you need to adjust the GPIO settings to get your card up.
And you are ready.
```python
troyalab.setupGPIO()
troyalab.powerUp()
troyalab.getHardwareInfo()
```
