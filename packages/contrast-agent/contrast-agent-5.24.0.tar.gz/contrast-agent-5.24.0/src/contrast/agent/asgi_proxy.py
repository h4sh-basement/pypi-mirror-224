    Wraps an ASGI application callable to apply our middleware. Anything defined as an
    ASGI 3.0 application object (https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest) can be proxied

    This is implemented as a wrapt object proxy. A proxied ASGI application can safely
    replace the original ASGI application even if more framework-level operations still
    need to be performed with the application object (such as route registration,
    configuration, etc).
