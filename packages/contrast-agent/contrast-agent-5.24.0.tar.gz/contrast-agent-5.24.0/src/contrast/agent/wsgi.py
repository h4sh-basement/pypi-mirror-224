    """
    Wraps a WSGI application callable to apply our middleware. Anything defined as a
    PEP-333(3) WSGI application object can be proxied by this object. It doesn't matter
    if the object is a function, class instance with `__call__`, or something else, as
    long as it's a valid callable WSGI application.

    This is implemented as a wrapt object proxy. A proxied WSGI application can safely
    replace the original WSGI application even if more framework-level operations still
    need to be performed with the application object (such as route registration,
    configuration, etc).

    This is for internal auto-instrumentation use only. Customers should use the
    WSGIMiddleware directly.
