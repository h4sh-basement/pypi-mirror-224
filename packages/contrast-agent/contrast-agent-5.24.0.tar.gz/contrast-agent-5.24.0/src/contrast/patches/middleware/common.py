        This is a very strange-looking patch. All of the confusing bits are the result
        of the automagic sequence of events that Python performs (in C) when a new
        object is constructed. For some details, see the documentation:

        https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__

        For _all_ the details, try to decipher the source code:

        cpython/Objects/typeobject.c

        Q: "Why do we call orig_func without args/kwargs?"
        A: In this case, orig_func is object.__new__. This function accepts exactly one
            argument - the type about to be instantiated. The constructor only accepts
            args and kwargs so it can pass these to __init__.

        Q: "Why do we have to call __init__ in this patch?"
        A: Usually, __init__ is called after __new__ returns the new instance. However,
            there is a condition (in the docs):
            > If __new__() does not return an instance of cls, then the new instance's
            > __init__() method will not be invoked.
            In this patch, we're returning a proxy, not the original object. Apparently,
            the internal python machinery responsible for deciding if __init__ needs to
            be called or not is -not- fooled by the proxy. This means that if we don't
            call __init__ in this patch, it'll never be called at all, and the application
            instance will be hopelessly broken.

        Q: "Can we use @wrapt.function_wrapper?"
        A: Apparently not. Because object.__new__ is a builtin, something internal to
            wrapt fails when we try this. It's totally possible that I've missed some
            detail, but I wasn't able to get it to work after playing around with it.
