# win-roboco-py
A thin python wrapper around Window's [Robocopy utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy).

This package is not intended to cover 100% of Robocopy's functionality.
Instead, the focus of the package is allow you to easily take advantage of Robocopy's robustness for the most common operations.
