The Plugin library is a Python package designed to provide a simple and efficient way to perform kernel-based data analysis using the plugin algorithm. The plugin algorithm, proposed by P. Hall & Marron (1987) and extended by Park & Marron (1990), offers an iterative algorithm for the estimation of the optimal bandwidth parameter.
The plugin  utilizes an iterative algorithm to find the optimal smoothing parameter. The principle starts with a random choice of J(f), and subsequent evaluations of J(f) are deduced from the first value. Several iterations are performed to converge towards the optimal bandwidth parameter.
