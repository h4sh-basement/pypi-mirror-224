## AutoClip

*Automagically* clip out objects obstructing your sign.

### Install

*Lua*   
* Install AutoClip from DependencyControl.  
* If you prefer to manually install AutoClip, AutoClip's dependencies are `ILL.ILL`, `aka.config`, `aka.config2`, `aka.outcome`, `aka.unicode`, which is available at [TypesettingTools/ILL-Aegisub-Scripts](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/ILL-Aegisub-Scripts) and from DependencyControl, and [Akatmks/Akatsumekusa-Aegisub-Scripts](https://github.com/Akatmks/Akatsumekusa-Aegisub-Scripts) which you have to install yourself.  

*Python*  
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [VapourSynth](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases).  
* AutoClip requires additional VapourSynth plugins to be installed. Run `python3 vsrepo.py install lsmas fmtc dfttest` from VapourSynth's install path.  
* If you are using a portable version of Python and VapourSynth, in Aegisub, Select „Automation > AutoClip > Configure python path“ and paste in the path to your python executable.  

### Usage

1. Time your sign to the whole cut.  
You may already fbf or divide the lines into sections prior to clipping, in which case select all the lines that adds up to the cut.  
2. Create a rect clip that covers your sign. This clip defines the area where AutoClip will be active. Anything outside this clip will not be clipped.  
3. Seek the video to a frame where, ideally, the sign is unobscured from the foreground object.  
4. Select „Automation > AutoClip > AutoClip“ and a new AutoClip window shall open.  
5. In the new window, adjust the slider until you get a satisfactory clip and click „Apply“.

### TODO

- Handle moving signs/tracking data for those  
- More sliders (probably bunch of other VS filters to fine-tune the clip area)  
- Simplifying the clips to curves and such.  
- Currently only the longest contour gets taken into account. Maybe combine them? Maybe a slider for this?
