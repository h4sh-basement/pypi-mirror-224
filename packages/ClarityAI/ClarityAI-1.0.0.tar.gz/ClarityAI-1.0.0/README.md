ClarityAI is a comprehensive Python package designed to empower machine learning practitioners with a wide range of interpretability methods to enhance the transparency and explainability of their ML models.

## Installation
You can install ClarityAI using pip:
```
pip install clarityai
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can import ClarityAI and start using its features:

```python
import clarityai
```

## Key Features
To be completed.

## Limitations
ClarityAI is designed to help users quickly integrate interpretability methods into their personal projects. However, ClarityAI is just a tool meant to help users - not replace users' own judgments on interpretability and ethical use cases of their ML models.

Please also note that ClarityAI is a package created for fun/educational purposes! There exist several popular interpretability libraries available in the Python ecosystem, which are much better designed and maintained, such as [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), [Yellowbrick](https://www.scikit-yb.org/en/latest/), and [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret).
