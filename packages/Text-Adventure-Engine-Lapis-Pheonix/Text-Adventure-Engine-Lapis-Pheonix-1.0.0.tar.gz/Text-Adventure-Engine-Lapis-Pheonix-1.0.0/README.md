Example 1: Using the Item and Stack Classes
```py
from items import Item, Stack

# Create an iron sword item with a custom description
iron_sword = Item("Iron Sword", "A sturdy weapon made of iron.", stack_size=1)

# Create a stack of apples
apple = Item("Apple")
apple_stack = Stack(apple, stack_size=10)
apple_stack.push(5)

# Print the current stack size of the apple stack
print(f"Current stack size of apples: {len(apple_stack)}")
```

Example 2: Interacting with Characters and Inventory
```py
from interaction import Interaction
from character import Person
from items import Item

# Create a character named "Player" with a custom inventory size and description
player = Person("Player", "A skilled adventurer.", (255, 255, 255), health=100, armor=50, inventory_size=20)

# Create a health potion item
health_potion = Item("Health Potion", "Restores health when consumed.")
health_potion_stack = Stack(health_potion, stack_size=5)

# Give the player a health potion
Interaction.give_item(player, health_potion)

# Try to give the player another health potion (inventory is full)
try:
    Interaction.give_item(player, health_potion)
except FullInventory as e:
    print(e)

# Take a health potion from the player's inventory
Interaction.take_item(player, health_potion)

# Try to take more health potions than available (error)
try:
    Interaction.take_item(player, health_potion, amount=3)
except ItemNotInInventory as e:
    print(e)
```

Example 3: Using Text Output for Character Interaction
```py
from character import Person
from text import Text

# Create a character named "NPC" with a custom text color
npc = Person("NPC", "A friendly villager.", (0, 128, 0), health=80, armor=20)

# Create a text instance with custom color
text_handler = Text((255, 165, 0))

# Make the NPC say a message using colored text output
text_handler.say(npc.get_name(), "Hello, traveler! Welcome to our village.")

# Create a player character and make them say a message
player = Person("Player", "An adventurous soul.", (0, 0, 255), health=120, armor=60)
text_handler.say(player.get_name(), "Greetings! Thank you for your warm welcome.")
```
