- I found SQLAlchemy to difficult to try to understand, so I will understand it and make it easier



## Roadmap

- v0.4-alpha - I plan to finish functionality for the createTable function and the createColumn function
- v0.5-alpha - I plan to add functionality for basic sql statements like INSERT, UPDATE, and POP.
