# Robert Penner's Easing Functions

There are a plethora of versions available of these, many of which provide an
object oriented interface, while most of the original easing functions could
be simple inline expressions.

This library takes the purely functional approach.  No class instantiation,
just a function call.

See https://easings.net for a good visualisation of these to chose the right
one.
