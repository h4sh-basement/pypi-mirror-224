# CloudSDP Library

The CloudSDP library is designed to simplify the creation and management of serverless data pipelines between Google Cloud Run and Google BigQuery. It provides a developer-friendly interface to extract data from various sources, transform it, and seamlessly load it into BigQuery tables, all while leveraging the power of serverless architecture.

## Features

TODO:

- **Data Extraction and Ingestion**: Extract data from various sources, convert it into a common format, and ingest it into BigQuery tables.
- **Data Transformation**: Perform data transformations, such as cleaning, enrichment, and normalization, before loading into BigQuery.
- **Scheduled Jobs and Triggers**: Schedule data pipeline jobs based on time triggers using Cloud Scheduler.
- **Data Pipeline Workflow**: Define and orchestrate data pipeline workflows with configurable execution order and dependencies.
- **Conflict Resolution and Error Handling**: Implement conflict resolution strategies and error handling mechanisms for reliable data processing.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor job progress, resource utilization, and performance metrics using integrated logging and monitoring tools.
- **Documentation and Examples**: Comprehensive documentation and code examples to guide developers in using the library effectively.

## Installation

Install the library using pip:

`pip install cloudsdp`

Or, install the library using poetry:

`poetry add cloudsdp`
